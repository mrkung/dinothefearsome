            <h1>Mr. Dino</h1>
            <p>Before becoming web developer, Dino used to have no friends or hobbies. He was depressed and very sad because he didn't know what to do with his life. One day he found an old computer someone threw away in the forest. It had atom and VS code installed on it and that made Dino curious. Since then he found his passion making websites. Although he tries to be scary, he is actually quite nerdy and loves helping people.</p>
